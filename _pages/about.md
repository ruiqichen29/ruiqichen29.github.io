------

I'm pursuing the Ph.D. degree in Engineering Sciences at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. 
From 2020 to 2023, I served as a Research Assistant with VeriMake Innovation Lab, Fudan University and Southeast University, respectively. I received my M.S. degree in Integrated Circuit Engineering from Fuzhou University in 2020. My research interests include domain-specific architecture and FPGA-based accelerators.

You can find my CV here: [Ruiqi Chen's Curriculum Vitae](../files/RickyCV.pdf).

You can contact me via [Email](mailto:ruiqi.chen@vub.be) or [WeChat](../images/wechat.png).
