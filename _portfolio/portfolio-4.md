  * An FPGA-based flexible detection system for gutter oil is proposed for the first time based onmulti-dimensional features and machine learning.
  * An optimized iris recognition architecture is proposed and deployed to FPGA to realize real-time iris recognition; 
  * An FPGA-based highly-integrated wearable edge device thatlocally recognizes hand gestures, rather than uploading data to the cloud as in previous studies.
